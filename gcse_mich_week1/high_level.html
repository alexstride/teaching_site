<h1>What do we mean by "high-level"?</h1>
<body>
	<p>In computer science, we use the term "high-level" to refer to things which are very detatched from the way that the computer actually functions. In constrast, "low-level" concepts will usually involve taking into account things like computer memory locations and individual processes. Don't worry if you don't understand what those things are for the moment; the whole point of high-level programming languages is that you don't have to understand them!</p>
