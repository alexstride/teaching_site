<h1>What do we mean by "Pseudocode"?</h1>
<body>
	<p>Ever heard the word "pseudonym"? If you have then you'll know that it's a fake name that an author uses when he/she doesn't want to be recognised (google 'Robert Galbraith' for an example).'Pseudo' comes from the Greek meaning 'fake', and 'nym' comes from the Greek meaning 'name'.</p>
	
	<p>The clever ones among you might, therefore, have worked out that pseudocode is effectively a fake code. The purspose of it is to be easy for humans to read and write, allowing us to get down our ideas without worrying about the fiddly details of writing actual exectuable code.</p>
	
	<p>For example, if I am coding in python and I want to open a file and read all of lines as entries in a list, I will start of by writing the following comment lines:
		
		<br/><br/>#open up file
		<br/>#read all of the lines into a list
		<br/>#close the file
		<br/><br/>
		
And then later on I will come back and fill in the actual code, like this:
	
		<br/><br/>#open up filename.txt
		<br/>f = open("filename.txt","r")
		<br/>#read all of the lines into a list
		<br/>resultingList = [i for i in f.readline()]
		<br/>#close the file
		<br/>f.close()
		<br/><br/>
What's the point of doing things like this? Well, you can't code at the same speed that you think, so sometimes you just need to write stuff down in English first, and then come back and do the coding later.</p>

<p>P.S. If you are wondering what the # symbols are doing, they are basically telling Python that it doesn't need to read the rest of the line, because it is a comment.</p>
